Cricket on the village green,  
Batsmen poised, a graceful scene.  
Leather ball and willow meet,  
Echoes ring in summer heat.  

Fielders dash with hopeful eyes,  
Chasing dreams beneath blue skies.  
Cheers erupt as wickets fall,  
Victory's hope inspires all.  

Gentle breeze and sunlight blend,  
Cricket's magic has no end.
